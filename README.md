# Larry_Game
This is my group university project, which is a platformer game developed with OpenGL, SDL, Bullet and NGL
This application is using some of the graphic libraries created by our lecturer at Bournemouth University (NCCA)

I was mainly responsible for wrapping up the Bullet Physics Engine, collisions/collision shapes, controls, debugging, import/export geometry, implementation of game features.
